This competition tested more than ideas. It tested real-world skills. India’s electronics sector continues to face a problem. Students graduate with theoretical knowledge but limited exposure to engineering practice. Classrooms teach circuit theory, microprocessors, and programming basics, but industry demands experience in [&#8230;]

A 1200V silicon carbide platform can fix them. Here’s what makes it different. Navitas Semiconductor has introduced its 5th-generation GeneSiC silicon carbide (SiC) platform, adding a new 1200V MOSFET family. The new devices improve power conversion performance with a 35% improvement in the balance between conduction [&#8230;]

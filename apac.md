This page is where all the WBG updates from APAC are funneled to.

🔹 Market Growth & Regional Leadership

Asia-Pacific leads the global WBG semiconductor market, holding a 46% share in 2024, with projections to grow from USD 0.98 billion in 2024 to USD 3.92 billion by 2034 at a CAGR of 14.87%. This growth is driven by EV adoption, 5G infrastructure, and renewable energy systems.
SiC and GaN semiconductors are the dominant materials, with SiC holding 58% market share and GaN expected to grow rapidly due to its role in RF and high-frequency applications.

🔹 Corporate Investments & Projects

Inventchip Technology (China) secured nearly 1 billion yuan in Series C funding to expand SiC wafer production and develop new products for EVs, photovoltaics, and industrial power supplies. 
Samsung, SK Hynix, and TSMC are investing heavily in next-gen semiconductor technologies, including WBG materials, to support AI, EVs, and industrial automation
China’s CAS successfully validated a radiation-resistant SiC power device in space, improving power module efficiency from 85% to 95%.

🔹 Research & Innovation Highlights

GF Machining Solutions introduced the LASER S 500 U, a high-speed SiC wafer processing system that reduces production time and cost, enabling efficient resizing of wafers for reuse.
AIP Publishing is hosting a special topic on ultrawide bandgap (UWBG) semiconductors, focusing on advanced synthesis, device design, and emerging applications. Guest editors include experts from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

🔹 Academic & Industry Collaboration

The IEEE WiPDA-Asia 2025 workshop will be held in Beijing, bringing together researchers and engineers to discuss WBG power devices, including ultra-wide bandgap materials, packaging, and applications in energy and telecom systems.
Topics include high-efficiency converters, gate drive circuits, and applications in EVs, renewable energy, and 5G.

🔹 Emerging Trends

High-power applications dominate the APAC WBG market, especially in automotive and renewable energy, with SiC capturing 87.7% of the material share.
GaN is gaining traction for high-speed switching and RF applications, particularly in telecom and aerospace.
